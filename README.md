MEDIOEX is basically Raspberry shield. Even if Raspberry has been a popular worldwide hobby in the last decades, we have transformed it into an engine which could be utilized in industrial environments thanks to our rich experience in the heavy industry. This document contains application samples regarding the commissionning of the card. Detailed information on MEDIOEX is shared in this document. The student and engineers may utilize in industrial environments thanks to such information on Raspberry shared in this Document. 
MEDIOEX contains the following features:

16ch isolated Digital Input
16ch Digital Output ( 4 ch 250V relay, 12 ch 24VDC transistor output)
4ch 12bit Analog Input  
4ch 12bit Analog Output 
Real time clock
1ch Rs232
1ch Rs485
Including temperature sensor LM75bd
i2c terminal output 

The below features should be added to the abovementioned features:
64-bit quad-core ARMV8 processor.
1.2GHz 1GB RAM.
WiFi - BCM43143.
Bluetooth 4.1 (Bluetooth Low Energy - BLE)
4chUSB 2.
4ch Stereo and Composite video output

Several tests have been performed on MEDIOX and raspberry so that the former and the latter could be utilized in industrial environments. You may perform the following test on Medioex and raspberry.

#1 remote control IO from cloud,
#2 Serial bus reading ex. energy analyzer etc.

Even if the above scenario might seem very easy to occur, the realization of this scenario with PLC and industrial PC is very costly. You will have the chance to minimize the costs of the engines thanks to the utilization of Medioex and Raspberry. Consequently, you will be able to focus on software without having to deal with the hardware issues.
